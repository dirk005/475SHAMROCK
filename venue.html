                            The “Plot” (Die Plot) as we called <b>475 @ Shamrock</b>, Bredell has been home to a
                            variety of activities since 1978 such as weddings, birthday celebrations, meetings and school group
                            activities. Sections or rooms from the two relative large residences were let out since 1988.
                             <br />
                            The first school group accommodated at the Plot was in 1983 with a group from Laerskool Impala. Since
                            then the activities evolved into three distinct directions namely educational, group activities and
                            adventures, parties, braais and the visits from friends and even of oversees tourists.
                            <br/>
                            <b>475 @ Shamrock</b> lies near to the heart of the Jansen van Rensburg family. This is the place where the
                            children and grandchildren played in the bush, trees and climbed with ropes. The summers have been
                            the place for swimming and family gatherings under the tree next to the swimming pool.
                        <br />
                            “Die Plot” has
                            been a refuse for all with “Ouma’s” Bean soup or pancakes during rainy days and cold winters.
                    <br />
                            Recently Oupa Sarel handed the button of taking care of business to the children. The responsibility now
                            lies with Dr. Pieter van Rensburg who enjoyed organizing a variety of leadership, personal development
                            trainings and school camps over the past 30 years. The two residences were recently renovated to
                            improve the standards of service to our customers.
